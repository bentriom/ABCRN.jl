# MarkovProcesses.jl 

A Julia package for efficient simulation, statistical inference and verification of Continuous Time Markov Chains.

It implements:

* A core of simulation for Markov Processes
* Synchronized simulation with Linear Hybrid Automata.
* Approximate Bayesian Computation (a likelihood-free inference method)
* Automaton-ABC: a statistical method for verification of parametric CTMC (cite paper)

## Install

This package is not yet accessible via the Julia package manager. For installatation of the package:

1. Clone this git repository on your computer.
2. Add the "core" directory of this repository to your LOAD_PATH. This can be done by two different ways:
    * Add the Julia line code 
` import Distributed: @everywhere
@everywhere push!(LOAD_PATH, /path/to/markovprocesses.jl/core")`
on your Julia startup file which is often located in `~/.julia/config/startup.jl` in Unix systems.
    * If you don't want to add this in your startup file, you can add these lines in your Julia script before `using MarkovProcesses`.

## Getting started 

A few notebooks are available in examples/notebooks for a quick presentation of the different features of the package.

## Test

Execution tests and statistical tests are available. It can be run by:

`julia tests/run_all.jl`

!!! Statistical tests
    The statistical tests run by tests/run_cosmos.jl needs Cosmos in your PATH environment variable.

## Benchmarks

Efforts have been made for efficient computation of simulations with 100% Julia code. These benchmark can be found in bench/. 

## Info

This package was written during my PhD thesis. The mathematical fundations and the package archtecture are presented in it.
